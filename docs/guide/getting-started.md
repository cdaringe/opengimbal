# Getting started

It's gimbal time!

## Tools you will need

- A 3d printer, access to a 3d printer, or ability to order 3d printed parts from a 3d printing service online.
- Common hobbyist tools: screw drivers, allen wrenches, etc.
- Electronics hobbyist tools: soldering station, multimeter, wire stripper, etc.

If you do not have access to these tools, someone in your community does. We recommend searching online for a [makerspace](https://makerspaces.make.co/) in your city. Search also for hackerspace or similar terms as the link above is far from exhaustive!

## Materials

See each of the [../systems](Systems) pages.

- Visit each page's procurement/Bill-of-materials (BOM) section
- Order all the parts required for each system
- üï∞Ô∏è Wait for everything to show up!

## [Next - Build the mechanical system](./build-mechanical)
